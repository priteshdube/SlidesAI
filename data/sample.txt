AI Agent for Presentations

This project builds an AI agent using the Gemini API to automatically generate professional slide decks. 
It will parse an input document,structure the content, and create a complete presentation file. 
The agent will leverage various tools for tasks like image generation, data visualization, and final document formatting.
The goal is to dramatically reduce the time and effort required to create a polished presentation.
